Write the content based on the outline and research. First draft should be
complete but may need refinement.

Target lengths by format:
- Blog: 800-1200 words
- Social thread: 5-8 posts, punchy

Each iteration should improve quality based on editor feedback.

Review the draft. Score it 1-10 on: clarity, engagement, accuracy, structure.

If score < 8, provide specific feedback for improvement.

Be constructive but demanding.
