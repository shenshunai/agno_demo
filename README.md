# Demo AgentOS

A reference AgentOS application built with Agno.

This repo packages a broad set of agent patterns into one runnable system: standalone agents, multi-agent teams, scheduled workflows, shared memory, guardrails, approvals, and external integrations. You can run it locally, inspect each example in isolation, and use it as a starting point for your own AgentOS.

The architecture is intentionally simple. Fourteen agents, eleven teams, and five workflows run inside one FastAPI service with PostgreSQL for persistence and shared context. The goal is not to show off a feature checklist. It is to show how agentic systems can be built with ordinary application architecture, clear boundaries, and production-minded patterns.

Use this project to:

1. **See how core Agno patterns fit together in a single app.**
2. **Explore working examples of memory, RAG, tool use, scheduling, guardrails, and collaboration modes.**
3. **Extend the system with your own agents, teams, workflows, and integrations.**

## Quick Start

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/demo-os.git demo-os
cd demo-os

cp example.env .env
# Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY

# Start the application
docker compose up -d --build

# Load SaaS data for Dash
docker exec -it demo-os-api python -m agents.dash.scripts.load_data
docker exec -it demo-os-api python -m agents.dash.scripts.load_knowledge
```

Confirm the system is running at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

## Deploy to Railway

Requires:
- [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your environment

```sh
railway login

./scripts/railway_up.sh
```

The script provisions PostgreSQL, configures environment variables, and deploys the application.

### Connect the Web UI

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com)
2. Click "Add OS" -> "Live"
3. Enter your Railway domain

### Manage deployment

```sh
railway logs --service agno-demo      # View logs
railway open                         # Open dashboard
railway up --service agno-demo -d    # Update after changes
```

To stop services:
```sh
railway down --service agno-demo
railway down --service pgvector
```

### Load data in production

```sh
# Dash — table schemas, validated queries, and business rules
railway run python -m agents.dash.scripts.load_knowledge

# Dash — SaaS data (customers, subscriptions, invoices, usage, support)
railway run python -m agents.dash.scripts.load_data
```

## Common Tasks

<details>
<summary><strong>Add your own agent</strong></summary>

1. Create `agents/my_agent/` with these files:

**`agents/my_agent/agent.py`**
```python
from agno.agent import Agent

from agents.my_agent.instructions import INSTRUCTIONS
from app.settings import MODEL, agent_db

my_agent = Agent(
    id="my-agent",
    name="My Agent",
    model=MODEL,
    db=agent_db,
    instructions=INSTRUCTIONS,
    enable_agentic_memory=True,
    add_datetime_to_context=True,
    add_history_to_context=True,
    read_chat_history=True,
    num_history_runs=5,
    markdown=True,
)
```

**`agents/my_agent/instructions.py`**
```python
INSTRUCTIONS = """\
You are a helpful assistant.
"""
```

**`agents/my_agent/__init__.py`**
```python
from agents.my_agent.agent import my_agent as my_agent
```

**`agents/my_agent/__main__.py`**
```python
from agents.my_agent.agent import my_agent

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_agent.cli_app(stream=True)
```

2. Register in `app/main.py`:

```python
from agents.my_agent import my_agent

agent_os = AgentOS(
    agents=[..., my_agent],
    ...
)
```

3. Add quick prompts to `app/config.yaml` using the agent's `id`

4. Restart: `docker compose restart`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Add tools to an agent</strong></summary>

Agno includes 100+ tool integrations. See the [full list](https://docs.agno.com/tools/toolkits).

```python
from agno.tools.slack import SlackTools
from agno.tools.scheduler import SchedulerTools

my_agent = Agent(
    ...
    tools=[
        SlackTools(),
        SchedulerTools(db=agent_db),
    ],
)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Use a different model provider</strong></summary>

1. Add your API key to `.env` (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
2. Update agents to use the new provider:

```python
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5")
```
3. Add dependency: `anthropic` in `pyproject.toml`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Connect to Slack</strong></summary>

Slack gives AgentOS two capabilities: receiving messages (DMs, @mentions, threads) and sending messages (proactive posts from Dash). Each thread maps to a session ID for conversation context.

1. Get a public URL (ngrok for local, deployed URL for production)
2. Create a Slack app from the manifest in the setup guide
3. Install to your workspace
4. Add `SLACK_TOKEN` and `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` to `.env`
5. Restart: `docker compose up -d --build`

See [docs/SLACK_CONNECT.md](docs/SLACK_CONNECT.md) for the full setup guide with the app manifest.

</details>

## Evals

The eval framework tests all 30 entities across multiple dimensions: basic functionality, tool call correctness, secret leakage, response quality, and latency.

```sh
# Smoke tests (fast, free)
python -m evals smoke                          # All entities
python -m evals smoke --group agents           # By group
python -m evals smoke --entity docs       # Single entity

# Tool call validation (fast, free)
python -m evals reliability

# LLM-judged evals (uses GPT-5.4 as judge)
python -m evals                                # All categories
python -m evals --category accuracy            # Single category

# Performance baselines
python -m evals perf --update-baselines        # Establish baselines
python -m evals perf                           # Compare against baselines

# Improvement loop
python -m evals improve --entity docs     # Debug a failing entity
python -m evals improve --failures             # Debug all failures
```

See [docs/EVALS.md](docs/EVALS.md) for the full eval system documentation.
