    "3. ACTIONABILITY: Does it provide concrete, useful information?\n"
    "4. CONCISENESS: Is it appropriately detailed without padding or filler?\n"
    "Score 1-10. A score of 7+ means the response is good across all dimensions.\n"
    "Score below 7 if it is vague, disorganized, padded, or incomplete."
